% Arguments:
%           <x>: mono input audio, with size (numSamples,1)
%           <k>: pulse locations, with size (numPulses,1)
%           <g>: pulse gains, with size (numPulses,1)
%           <B>: pulse filter coeffs, with size (feedforward order, numFilters, numStages)
%           <A>: pulse filter coeffs, with size (feedback order, numFilters, numStages)
%           <gAll>: Allpass filter gains
%           <dAll>: Allpass filter delays
%           <filtList>: list of which pulses connects to which filter, with size (numPulses,1)
% Outputs:
%           <y>: DVN convolution result
